## Description
Video Guide of all Features - [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uYZVd0fhgjsjVbMPWgTYTUMVylddx1l/view?usp=sharing)

This project was inspired by the sports talk show First Take. The show consists of several sports commentators who have debates on topics that are trending in the sports world. I often found many fans giving thier opinions in the comments and on social media, so I wanted to create an application which allows fans to interact with each other and replicate those same discussions as on First Take.
